# AutoGuard
AutoGuard is a [Tasker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm) project and app that automates [AdGuard for Android](https://adguard.com/adguard-android/overview.html) to bring together VPN and advanced ad blocking without root access.

**But isn't there [AdGuard VPN](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adguard.vpn) already?**

Sure, AdGuard and AdGuard VPN can work in Integrated mode, but what if you use Hiddify/Nekobox/Shadowsocks/other client? For these AutoGuard acts as an artificial Integrated mode. Not as convenient for sure, but nah, better than nothing.

## It doesn't support any VPN
**Only those** VPN apps are supported that can work in a **proxy mode**. This means that **any one-button commercial VPNs** from Play Store, such as Planet VPN, Turbo VPN, ExpressVPN, NordVPN and so on, **are not supported**. Unfortunately, I can't do anything about it.
